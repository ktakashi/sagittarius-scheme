HACKING
=======

This file is for those who want s to hask the cutting-edge Sagittarius
sources from the Git repository. If you just want to compile
from the distribution, you don't need to read any further.

How to check out from the repository
------------------------------------

This section is for those who are not fimiliar with Git commands. As a
preconditions, Git is installed on your environment.

### Basic commands for Git

#### Clone

```shell
git clone https://bitbucket.org/ktakashi/sagittarius-scheme sagittarius
```

The last `sagittarius` is destination directory name.

#### Checkout

Following command switches between branches.

```shell
git checkout ${branch name}
```

If you don't specify any branch name, then current branch will be used.

#### Commit

```shell
git commit -am 'comment'
```

It's better to use interactive mode:

```shell
git commit --interactive
```

How to build HEAD code
----------------------

To build HEAD code, you need the latest release of Sagittarius
Scheme. So first please install it.

### Provided developer tool

We provide `dist.sh` for developer and it generates boot code, VM
instructions and generated code from stub file.

### Generate code

To generate code you need to execute following commands;

```shell
./dist.sh stub
./dist.sh precomp
./dist.sh srfi
./dist.sh tz
./dist.sh unicode
./dist.sh html
```

Or this command does the same;

```shell
./dist.sh gen
```

These commands generate C files from stub files and Scheme files
respectively. This must be run *before* CMake command otherwise CMake
process will fail.

If you set the path to Sagittarius executable to the environment
variable `SASH` with, then `dist.sh` will use that executable file.

```shell
env SASH=/opt/bin/sagittarius ./dist.sh gen
```

To clean the generated code, you need to execute following command;

```shell
./dist.sh clean
```

#### Using local TZ database and Unicode files

If you want to use local TZ database file or Unicode files, you can
locate the following files into `tzdata` and `unicode/data`
directories respectively. If there is no such directory yet, then you
can create them manually.

##### For TZ database

- tzdata-latest.tar.gz [Download](ftp://iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz)
- windowsZones.xml [Download](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml)

NOTE: all of above files are removed when `./dist.sh tz` command is
executed. If you want to reuse them, make sure you copy them before
you run the command.

##### Unicode files

- CaseFolding.txt
- CompositionExclusions.txt
- DerivedCoreProperties.txt
- GraphemeBreakProperty.txt
- PropList.txt
- SpecialCasing.txt
- UnicodeData.txt
- WordBreakProperty.txt

Above Unicode files can be downloaded from the Unicode FTP site:
[ftp.unicode.org](ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/).  Currently,
Sagittarius uses version 12.1.0, if you want to use newer/older
version, you can also use them. (May break some of test cases,
especially if you use unicode version older than 6.3.0)


Performance optimisation
------------------------

There are two parts of performance optimisation, C and Scheme world.
For C, we recommend to use `gpreftools` (at least I'm using it, please
let me know if you have better options). Due to the limitation of the
tool, you may want to comment out `dlclose` call in `src/dl_dlopen.c`
so that the tool can emit proper names instead of hex addresses.
