# Sagittarius Scheme System

# What is this?

This is a free Scheme implementation, supporting R6RS and R7RS
specification.

# How to build and install?

Sagittarius uses CMake for its building infrastructure.  If you do not
have it on your platform, please install it.

 - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)
 
 NOTE: It should be higher than 3.5, though we don't use new features, so
 it should also work with 2.8.4

## Quick build/install (for Unix like environment)

If your environment already has required libraries and just want to
install to default location, run the following commands in the
directory where all distributed files are expanded (c.f. By default
it'd be `sagittarius-X.X.X`, `X.X.X` is the version you downloaded):

    % cmake .
    % make
    % make install

Following sections describes more details.

## Preparation for Unix-like environment

Sagittarius depends on the following libraries.

 - [Boehm GC](http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/)
 - [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/)
 - [libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/)
 - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

If you are using Linux which supports `apt-get`, then you can simply
execute the following command:

    % apt install libgc-dev, zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev

### Manual installation of Boehm GC

For Boehm GC, you need to install it with the option
`--enable-threads=pthreads`.  If your CPU is not incredibly old, you
can also specify the option `--enable-parallel-mark`.

If you are too lazy to download the archive file of GC, CMake will
download it for you.  Make sure to run the following commands from in
GC directory:

    % ./configure \
          --enable-threads=pthreads   \
          --enable-parallel-mark      \
          --enable-large-config
    % make
    % make install

Note: most of the Linux distributions already have Boehm GC in their
package management system, such as `apt-get`.  I recommend to use it
for security reason.

## Building on Unix-like environment

After installing CMake and dependent libraries, you are ready to build
Sagittarius; type the following command:

    % cmake .

Note: The above command assumes you are in the source directory.

It is possible to build Sagittarius in a directory that is not the top
source directory of the distributed package (out-of-tree building);
for example:

    % mkdir build
    % cd build
    % cmake ${path to Sagittarius' source directory}
    % make

To run the tests, specify `test` target.

    % make test
	
Or, alternatively, you can also use `ctest`. This is convenient to
test individual tests.

To install Sagittarius non default location, you need to specify
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable.

    % cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install

On some environment, there are 64 bits runtime specific directories
such as `lib64`. To install Sagittarius runtime in the directory, then
you can specify `LIB_DIR` variable as the following:

    % cmake . -DLIB_DIR=lib64

Then the runtime install directoy will be
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/LIB_DIR`.  There are also the variables to
specify `bin`, `include` and `share` directories, and the directory
for the `.pc` files; `BIN_DIR`, `INCLUDE_DIR` `SHARE_DIR`, and
`PKGCONFIG_DIR`, respectively.

Since 0.5.6, Sagittarius's REPL is renamed to `sagittarius` and legacy
`sash` is kept as a symbolic link. If you don't need the symbolic link
then you can put the `INSTALL_SYMLINK` option off as the following:

    % cmake . -DINSTALL_SYMLINK=0

After a successful compilation, it is possible to install Sagittarius
to the location specified by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` or default system
location if it's not specified with the command:

    % make install

After installation, you might need to run `ldconfig` to run
Sagittarius properly.

Note: For some reason, you might want to build a 32-bit runtime on a
64-bit platform.  The following command can be used for this purpose;

    % cmake . \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${your 32 bit C++ compiler} \
        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER={your 32 bit C compiler}

Make sure you have all the required 32-bit executables and libraries.

## Building on Mac OS X

Only with Homebrew is tested. A user can install sagittarius directly with
homebrew, via

    $ brew install sagittarius-scheme
    
Alternately, the user can install the following dependencies and then make
sagittarius locally.

Installing libffi, CMake, Boehm GC and OpenSSL.

    $ brew install libffi cmake bdw-gc openssl

After installing dependent libraries, the rest of the process are the same
as Unix-like environment.

If `cmake` can't find `libffi`, then you can specify the location via
`FFI_LIBRARY_DIR` option like the following.

    $ cmake . -DFFI_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libffi/3.4.6/lib

Note: some Mac OS X environment may not be able to find `ar` command
because `/usr/bin/gcc` is identical as `/usr/bin/clang`. In that case,
export `CC` and `CXX` environment variable with proper GCC and G++
command path respectively so that CMake can find the command.

## Building on FreeBSD

FreeBSD has multiple type of Boehm GC system libraries; `gc`,
`gc-threaded` and `gc-redirect`. Sagittarius requires threaded runtime
to make thread library works properly. The building process checks if
`gc` has `GC_get_parallel()` function and if it doesn't then tries to
use `gc-threaded` library. Please make sure your system has
`gc-threaded` or `gc` built with multi thread option.

NB: If you install `gc` without build option, then default is without
thread support. In such a case, you need to install `gc-threaded` as
well.

## Building on Windows (non Cygwin environment)

On Windows, you need to create an installer and Sagittarius is using
innosetup for it.  Please install it.

 - [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/)

You need to install MSVC preferably Visual Studio 2010 or higher.  And
if you use `cmake-gui`, it will be much easier.  Run `Visual Studio
Command Prompt` and go to the directory which Sagittarius source codes
are expanded.

If you prefer to use `cmake` instead of `cmake-gui`, then the
following command needs to be executed:

    % cmake . -G"NMake Makefiles"

Specifying `-DDEBUG_VERSION=OFF` enables MSVC optimisations.

The final commands are almost the same as in Unix-like environments.

    % nmake
    % nmake test

After these commands, you move to the `win/` directory and double
click the file `innosetup.iss`.  Go to [Build] - [Compile], then it
will create the installer.  For more detail, please see Inno Setup's
document.

### Other Windows build tools

Experimentally, we support other build tools. Below are the supported ones:

- MSBuild
  ```bat
  % cmake .
  % msbuild /p:Configuration=Release Sagittarius.sln
  ```
- Ninja
  ```bat
  % cmake . -G"Ninja"
  % ninja
  ```

## Running test

The tests are executed via `CTest`. In case you want to have verbose output,
you can use `ctest` command. For example, the below command shows the output
of the test execution when the test failed.

```shell
% ctest --output-on-failure
```

For more options, please refer the official document of the 
[`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html)
